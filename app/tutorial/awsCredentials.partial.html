	To allow Brenda-Web access to create and access your AWS account and its resources, it needs to be given credentials
	that are linked to your account.
</p>
<hr />
<ol>
	<li>If you haven't already done so, <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/" target="_blank">create an AWS account</a></li>
	<li>Log in to the AWS web interface and click on <strong>"Identity & Access Management"</strong> found under <strong>"Security & Identity"</strong></li>
	<li>
		Click on the <strong>Users</strong> link which will take you to a list of the current users configured for this 
		account.  For fresh accounts, there should be a single user.  For the sake of simplicity, we'll leverage the 
		existing user.  If you so desire, you may create a new user or isolated linked accounts but doing so is beyond
		the scope of this tutorial.  For more information on security credentials, see the documentation
		<a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/managing-aws-access-keys.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
	</li>
	<li>Click on the user you'd like to use, then click on the <strong>Security Credentials</strong> tab.</li>
	<li>You should now see a <strong>Create Access Key</strong> button, click on it.</li>
	<li>
		A dialog will open with your security credentials.  You may display them in the dialog or optionally download them
		to a CSV file.  Note that once the dialog is closed, the credentials will no longer be accessible so make sure to
		grab them and place them somewhere secure.
	</li>
	<li>
		At the top of the Brenda-Web page, click on the <strong>AWS Config</strong> button.  This will open a dialog in which
		the AWS credentials should be inserted.  Place the access key ID and secret into their corresponding boxes in the dialog.
	</li>
	<li>
		For this tutorial, enter the value <code>us-east-1</code> in the <strong>AWS Region</strong> text box.  For more information
		on what region means, refer to the AWS
		<a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-regions-availability-zones.html" target="_blank">Regions and Availability Zones</a>
		documentation.
	</li>
	<li>Once the access key ID, secret, and region have been populated, click the <strong>Set Credentials</strong> button</li>
</ol>

<hr />
<p>
	Clicking <strong>Set Credentials</strong> will cause the tool to test the provided credentials agains AWS.  If this is your first
	time using the tool (or first time within the provided region), the security group check is likely to fail.  Clicking 
	the <strong>Fix it</strong> link that appears will let the tool attempt to create the security group in AWS. 
</p>
<p>
	To see the details of the created security group, it can be found by going to <strong>AWS</strong> then 
	<strong>EC2</strong> --> <strong>Security Groups</strong>.  Here, you should see a security group named 
	"brenda-web".  This is the security group that was created and you can see the details of what was created.
