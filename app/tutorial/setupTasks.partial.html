	To give the workers something to do, we need to populate the queue with a list of tasks.
</p>
<p>
	For this, we leverage a work template which defines the basic structure of the tasks.  The 
	template is expanded to a list of tasks by specifying the start and end frames.  The default 
	template is:
</p>
<p>
	<code>blender -b *.blend -F PNG -o $OUTDIR/frame_###### -s $START -e $END -j $STEP -t 0 -a</code>
</p>
<p>
	This template tells the workers to render each frame of the project as a single task.  The start and end frame
	inputs specify which frames are to be rendered.  
</p>

<ol>
	<li>Set the start and end frame fields as appropriate for your project</li>
	<li>
		The <strong>Work List</strong> shows the expanded list of tasks that will be enqueued allowing you to double
		check that things look alright
	</li>
	<li>Click the <strong>Queue Work</strong> button</li>
</ol>

<p>
	This will send the tasks to the selected queue and the progress bar will be updated to reflect the status.
</p>

<p>
	The current size of the queue can be seen below the queue selection drop down.  If a mistake was made, you may use the
	<strong>Clear Queue</strong> button to clear all tasks from the queue.
